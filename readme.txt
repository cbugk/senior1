3 files remaining of multiple attempts on recreating paper by Bolenghi, Boman, and Delin.

MATLAB code listed were failed attempts, are listed as a showcase for final report of the course.

trial1 plots all rows per digit (When plots are inspected, binary output is observed in plots; and they form 10-by-10, rank7 matrix).
trial2 is not that valuable
trial3 was the latest attempt with rather smart move of using MATLAB's regress() function. Yet once again failed, as regress() stated rank was insufficient (see: trial1's note above)
